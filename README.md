This project implements an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity.
It adheres to the ERC20 standard, enabling compatibility with wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications (dApps).

This project showcases InflaToken, a semi-decentralized token designed to achieve 2% inflation.
The token contract functions like a central bank, attempting to manage inflation through a Global Interest Rate.
In essence, it acts as a semi-decentralized central banking system.

Utilizing and implementing:
1. Ethereum blockchain development with the Solidity language, along with Truffle and Ganache tools.
2. Frontend development using React.js.
3. Unit tests to validate the blockchain backend code.
4. Automation scripts for testing and configuration management.



Getting started:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```
2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Deploy to a local development Ethereum blockchain network (using Ganache tool is recommended).
   Run the following predefined command:
```
npm run deploy
```
4. Start React development server to inspect the DApp in the browser:
```
npm start
```
